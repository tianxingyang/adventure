# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The adventure game framework is a web-based application that enables users to create, design, and deploy interactive text-based adventure games. The system provides a visual node editor for game designers to create branching narratives with conditional logic, and generates playable web versions of the games. The framework consists of two main components: a game designer interface for creating games through drag-and-drop functionality, and a game player interface for experiencing the created adventures.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports creating engaging interactive content platforms that allow both creators and consumers to participate in narrative experiences. It promotes user-generated content and provides tools for creative expression in the gaming domain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Node Editor

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to create game nodes with multiple choice options through a visual drag-and-drop interface, so that I can design branching storylines without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a designer opens the editor THEN the system SHALL display a blank canvas with the ability to add nodes
2. WHEN a designer creates a new node THEN the system SHALL allow them to add a text description and multiple choice options
3. WHEN a designer drags from one node's option to another node THEN the system SHALL create a visual connection between them
4. WHEN a designer connects options to nodes THEN the system SHALL store the relationship for game flow logic
5. WHEN a designer saves the project THEN the system SHALL persist all nodes, options, and connections

### Requirement 2: Conditional Logic System

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to set conditions on choice options that must be met for players to select them, so that I can create complex branching narratives with prerequisites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a designer selects an option THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to add conditions
2. IF a condition is set on an option THEN the system SHALL only display that option to players when conditions are met
3. WHEN a player encounters a node THEN the system SHALL evaluate all option conditions and show only available choices
4. WHEN conditions involve game state THEN the system SHALL track and update state variables throughout gameplay

### Requirement 3: Game State Management

**User Story:** As a game player, I want my choices and progress to be tracked throughout the game, so that conditions and story elements can respond to my previous decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player makes a choice THEN the system SHALL update relevant state variables
2. WHEN a player reaches a new node THEN the system SHALL evaluate the current game state against any conditions
3. IF a player reloads the game THEN the system SHALL maintain their current progress and state
4. WHEN state variables change THEN the system SHALL make them available for condition evaluation

### Requirement 4: Game Export and Deployment

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to export my completed game as a standalone web application, so that players can access and play the game independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a designer completes their game THEN the system SHALL provide an export function
2. WHEN a game is exported THEN the system SHALL generate a self-contained web application
3. WHEN a player accesses the exported game THEN the system SHALL provide a clean playing interface without editing tools
4. IF the exported game is deployed THEN the system SHALL ensure all game logic functions correctly

### Requirement 5: Node Content Management

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to add rich text content to game nodes including descriptions and choice text, so that I can create engaging narrative experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a designer edits a node THEN the system SHALL provide a text editor for the main content
2. WHEN a designer adds choice options THEN the system SHALL allow custom text for each choice
3. WHEN a player views a node THEN the system SHALL display the content in a readable format
4. IF text content is lengthy THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate formatting and display options

### Requirement 6: Project Management

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to save, load, and manage multiple game projects, so that I can work on different adventures and maintain my work over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a designer creates a new project THEN the system SHALL initialize a blank game structure
2. WHEN a designer saves a project THEN the system SHALL store all game data with a project name
3. WHEN a designer loads a project THEN the system SHALL restore all nodes, connections, and settings
4. WHEN a designer lists projects THEN the system SHALL display all saved games with metadata

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- The visual editor SHALL respond to user interactions within 100ms
- Game export SHALL complete within 30 seconds for games with up to 1000 nodes
- The player interface SHALL load exported games within 5 seconds

### Security
- All user-generated content SHALL be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- Exported games SHALL not contain executable code beyond the game logic
- Project data SHALL be stored securely and accessed only by the creator

### Reliability
- The system SHALL auto-save project changes every 5 minutes
- Game state SHALL persist reliably across browser sessions
- The visual editor SHALL handle up to 1000 nodes without performance degradation

### Usability
- The drag-and-drop interface SHALL provide visual feedback for all interactions
- Error messages SHALL be clear and actionable when game logic issues are detected
- The exported game interface SHALL be intuitive for players without instruction
