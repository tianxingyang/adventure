# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
Implementation will follow a bottom-up approach, starting with data models and backend services, then building the API layer, and finally implementing the frontend components. Each task is designed to be atomic and completable by an AI agent in 15-30 minutes.

## Steering Document Compliance
Tasks follow Python package structure conventions with separate modules for models, services, and API routes. Frontend tasks organize components by feature with shared utilities. All tasks prioritize type safety and reusable patterns.

## Atomic Task Requirements
**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching
